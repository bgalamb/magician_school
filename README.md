# KineticWand

***Kinetic Wand is an android application that turns your device into a magic wand. 
You can practice magic with it.***

By befault it comes with a default set of magic spells and wands.

## Structure

1. __Codex (first icon)__
contains all the information about the magic spells that are needed for magician students. Such as the magic power that you get if you do it right as well as the kinetic movement (hand movement) that has to be performed
to do the magic. By tapping the practice button, you can navigate to the practicing screen.

2. __Wands (second icon)__
Is a catalogue of the different wands that are available. The more magic points you got, the better wand you can own. Better wands are less strict when they check if your movement is right.
For Intermediate and hard spells it is highly suggested to have a good wand.

3. __Practice (third icon)__
It is the screen where you can practice the learned spells and movements. 
You get points for every successful spell that you do. Magic speels only work if the word and the movement is right.

4. __multiplayer (switch)__ - Only available in _KineticWandPro_ - 
This is the way you enable that you are discoverable for wizards and witches around you.
You will see when someone connected to you and started a battle. During battles you can steal magic points from your opponent. 

## Customization
You can customize the number of spells, spell descriptions, all different power aspects and the spells themselves too with any movement and word that you want.
It is an ideal way for fantasy wizard and witch colonies to have their own dialects. 

You need minimal android technical skills to do so : be familiar with ADB command to replace a resource file within the application folder on your phone -file_name.json-.

## Disclaimer
Magic does not exist in real world, all above is done with programming and API-s that are provided by Android.
